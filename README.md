This project is the final project of the Re:Coded Frontend Web Development Bootcamp. It was done as a group project and my main responsibilities included the implementation of key features such as the registration process, the ability to add tickets and the ticket purchase page. I was also responsible for
implementing Firebase and i18n. The website serves as a communication platform between patients and therapists. Patients can create a profile, securely add credit cards, purchase tickets and make appointments with therapists. Therapists can also create and manage their own profiles.

- The project was developed using React
- Firebase is used to store user information.
- i18n integration is provided for use in different languages.
- Registration and login options have been added using Facebook and Google accounts.
- Redux is used for data management within the site.
- Tailwind is used for styling
- Prettier and Eslint

After the project was completed, I made changes to the responsive design.If you want to see original final project's codes: https://github.com/Recoded-Spark-Turkey-2022/Unboxed
